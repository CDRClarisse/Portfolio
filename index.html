										Using Figma and the clients provided information I created this prototype. Creating branding colors, font pairings, optimizing & creating images with AI for a unique feel.

										This prototype was created for a start up company, Floracare serves as a tool for the everyday shopper to maximize life to their store bought cut flowers. With this app you can scan bouquets and obtain information, education and reminders to keep your cut flowers fresh for even longer than before.
										
										I offered my rapid prototyping skills knowing I could handle the short time limit this start up company had with the scale of the project. Using Figma, Graphic Design as well as Interaction Design skills I creatted a user friendly interface using ther clients needs and ideas in accord with the Apple style guide.

										<div class="textbox"><a href="img/resume/smell game paper.pdf" download>Grab the Olfactory paper</a> 
											
											A maze built in Minecraft that triggers olfactory dispensers where players can only use their noses to guide them. I lead a team of five, designed the concept, created the maps, voiced the character, wrote the script and oversaw the olfaction dispenser creation. The first maze prototype had no light. Through a calibration phase using a derived psychological test known as semantic stimuli response measurement (a series of imagery in rapid succession paired with the smell. Example ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù, ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù paired with ‚Äúgood‚Äù smell), the player intuitively understands ‚Äúgood‚Äù ‚Äúcurious‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù smell. The good smell leading them to the exit of the maze, the bad smell leading them towards the monster, and their deaths. The curious smell to keys that unlock the path within the maze. With the power of Arduino and MLink, we were able to trigger smell dispensers.
											<br>This project was created by having a pitch meeting and people voting for their favorite pitches. My idea was to create a game that used Olfactory, or better known as Smell, to guide players, if they could be guided with direction and if they could be emotionally mannipulated through smell to enhance storytelling. Through smell dispersion that either encouraged or discouraged the player from doing certain actions and what sort of smells and how could we teach players those smells instinctivly? Here you can watch my pitch. <iframe width="800" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGwL7KhUL-Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
											<br>In summary, the game takes place in a quarantined hospital, you play a scientist who is loosing their mind and memories due to an illness and through a series of tapes discover the truth of what transpired in the hospital and why you are seemingly alone. Guided by good smells, the player is led to find the tapes and "clue smells" lead them to keys that open doors to further discover more.
											<br> <!--IMAGE HERE NOT SHOWING	<div class="main" data-img-url="img/portfolio/15.jpg"></div>	--> 
										Four different smells were programmed into the game, three of which were known to the player through a calibration phase. This calibration phase consisted of the player being shown a series of images and being exposed to the smell to see if they would cooralate "good" "clue leading" and "bad" smells. A surprise smell was introduced at the end of the game, this new smell was meant to catch the player off guard and surpise them as the mystery smell led them to a monster.	
										<br> <!--IMAGE HERE NOT SHOWING	<div class="main" data-img-url="img/portfolio/16.jpg"></div>	--> 
										<br>  In this video you can see our succesful attempt at pairing our Arduino smell dispersion setup with Mlink to trigger our olfactory dispenser through Minecraft input. As explained previously, certain cubes trigger certain smells. Therefore in this video you can see 4 different smells triggering.
										<iframe width="800" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iiAvV8BdLOw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<br> Given more time with the project, I would refine the olfactory dispenser and smell evacuation method. We attempted to have a fan pull the smells out, however, our method would pull all scents together and after long amounts of playing all smells would merge and make it confusing for the player. When given a cooldown period, removing the box and allowing the smells to disapate helped. But players were able to understand good and bad smell as directional cues, proving that this type of gameplay has potencial and deserves further exploraiton.

													<br>Malm√∂ Library opened to us with a problem in mind, how could they be more in service of the people, what did the people want and what were the current problems at the library that could be improved? Leading a team of five people, we interviewed library workers, library goers and those who didn‚Äôt use the library to highlight issues and try to get to the heart of the library‚Äôs problem. 
													<img src="img/portfolio/34.png"  />	
													<br>The library is funded by the government to support language learning opportunities to teach Swedish to all immigrants willing to learn and we turned most of our focus towards Malm√∂ being a melting pot of cultures. Thanks to our research, interviews, user tests with our card game, we concluded that to create lasting change we needed to promote lasting relationships between the Swedes and immigrants through usage of hobbies. With more hobby opportunities within the library immigrants could have more opportunities to practice their language caf√© skills. 
													<img src="img/portfolio/35.jpg"  />	
													<br><p> <i> Co-Designed space that illustrates how language caf√©s could be more open to the public rather than secluded in a reserved space.</i></p>
													The Co-design game is part of democratic design, it allows for ‚Äúnon designers‚Äù to step in and through methods of a game or even props can express their ideas more efficiently allowing interaction designers can get to the heart of a problem and create more designs that people actually want. In short it is an easier and more personal method of conducting user research.

											During the height of the pandemic I led a group of 4 people online to conduct an observational study between human and plant interactions. Together we collected information and data from 10 different testers. In summary we noted that the relationships between owner and plants was hindered from a lack of communication from the plants, or owners inability to understand the subtle silent signs their plants would give. Owners seemed frustrated by certain plants, had overwatering and underwatering issues. There are many products on the market for this very issue, many of those products require the user to look at a moist metre, a moisture indicator and other similar products. We placed a plant in the middle of a room and simply observed people interract with plants. We would ask them questions such as "How would you communicate with a plant?" to our surprise, many touched the plant as well as spoke to it. And after many ideas, brainstorming and a few prototypes my solution was to give the plant sound on touch. One touch could tell the user the state of their plant. We determined that if the plant sounded "off", then this may encourage the owner to take care of their plant. Inspire their curiousity to come and touch their plants and look at them more often, rather than the plant getting lost in the decor bond to its silent communication.

											With prototypes comes building and here can you see my successful attempt through the power of Arduino and coding, a plant responding to touch. The project in itself was very fulfilling and had I the musical talent I would have created different sounds to communicate ‚ÄúWet‚Äù ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù ‚ÄúDry‚Äù. The idea was to give people the ability to walk in their homes and with a simple touch as they walk by determining how all their plants are doing.

											<br><p>I created this project to explore the possible interactions between humans and wild animals, in this scenario; birds. Furthermore this project revealed the consequences of humans building for wildlife. Birdhouses were originally built to harvest and eat bird eggs, but later on birdhouses changed to become feeding points for our own viewing pleasure. As a consequence birds will change their feeding behaviors in the wild, change their territories based around feeders, and these feeders if not properly cleaned daily can harbor disease which can spread to all birds of different breeds who come to the birdhouse.</p>
											<img src="img/portfolio/43.gif"  />	
											<img src="img/portfolio/42.gif"  />	
											<br><p>The goal of the project was to inspire users to get to know each individual bird that came to the feeder, and make a sort of collector game out of it to encourage clean feeders while rewarding the human users with photos and video footage of their feathery friends.</p>
											<img src="img/portfolio/44.png"  />	
											<br><p>Using TeachableMachine an online machine learning tool powered by google to train a webcam to recognise certain bird species, was part of my project. Hours of filming my balcony and live streams gave me footage of 3 bird species but the most frequent visitors were Magpies. 
												Magpies are extremely smart and understood that everyday there would be delicious food, to the point of building their nest in the tree in front of my balcony to feed themselves and their young. They learned to not be afraid of my tripod and would even tap the window in the mornings if there was no more food! </p>
											<br><p>I created 3 different prototypes, UI‚Äôs for the ‚Äúgame‚Äù and much more, if you want more details of my work you can  <a href="img/resume/Pictoral Birdhouse.pdf" download>grab my Pictoral</a> </p>

											<p> <a href="img/resume/Lab report.pdf" download>Lab report</a> An audiosit is very much like a Radio Drama, where through voice acting and sound design the listener is transported to another world through storytelling. What differentiates this project, is that the listener is blindfolded and bound to a table. The character they are listening to is blind and sick in a hospital, the listener like the character doesn‚Äôt know what is going on and discovers the truth as the story progresses. The listener gets poked, touched, wind blown on and more to immerse them.</p> 
											<br>
										<p>	Before entering the dark room, the listener is offered a <a href="img/resume/Consent-Form audio sit.docx.pdf" download>consent form</a> to give them more stress before entering the dark room and being bound to a table blindfolded. The consent form has no legal power, but it puts the listener in a more anxious state which helps immerse them more. The listener is wearing sound canceling headset playing the video while the 5 of us follow the video instructions in our assigned spots and perform movements and actions.</p>
																					
										<br> <p>This project was the most fun I had with a team, every single person in that group was dedicated, put in late hours and passionate. Working with people like this was so motivating and inspiring that I still to this day think very fondly of them. The project was performed on renown sound designer Martin Hennel who enjoyed the sit and complemented it‚Äôs creativity. </p>

													<p> When 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons was released in 2014 there were no player accessories like we see today in 2023. Accessories that make the game easier such as spellbooks, play cards etc. To help my players I designed spell cards that would help them keep track of how many spells they had left and included spell casting rules so they could play on the go, rather than interrupt the flow by checking their character sheets or rulebooks. As well as conditional status chips to keep track of character conditions such as being poisoned, fatigued, dazed etc. As well as homebrew inspiration cards that give advantages to players.

													<p>The interface of the spellslot cards had several designs and ultimately I came up with an aesthetic card that can be reused by simple dry-erase methods. The player circles how many spellslots they have, and cross out the slots as they use spells so they can easily keep track of how many spells they have left. The art on these cards comes from Wizards of the Coast & Bioware games. </p>

													<p>Based on 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons, this game was created to be a secret PVP RPG. Players would be unaware of each other making for a more interesting dynamic. One team would be the Vampires, and the others the Hunters, each at the end of their session were given 3 opportunities to impact the war map. I created a world, new rulesets and new classes.</p>
												<p>I found that players tend to be more creative when fighting each other, and this was no exception. This experiment led to more interesting map dynamics as well as creative team decisions. </p>

												<p>Flexibility is the only way forward, design is about a back and forth process. Nothing is precious and nothing is permanent.</p>
												<p>This mentality was essential when working with other artists and writers, there is a balance to be had, diplomatic savy and of course the art of pinpointing the essence of the design to push forward to the final goal.</p>
												<p>Given less than a month, my team of 5 led under my direction was able to successfully carry out this chose your own adventure tale which involved writing, illustrations and programming within Twine. I worked closely with the programers and even learned the basics myself to help, this was a learning experience for me and helped me understand the time contraints and what is and isn't possible under certain time frames. This made me a better leader for it.</p>
												<p>If there is interest I can setup the game for you. I personally like to learn about every aspect of a project so I know what I can expect from my co-workers.</p>

												I created branding for an Etsy seller who would crochet little animals, flowers, baby blankets and more. She had a color scheme and had created her own banner but wanted something more offical. Working closely with her is the results you see, she also wanted a Deviant art journal skin which uses HTML with a custom cursor.

											If you hate those rentable E-scooters this is comic for you. Created the month they were released on the streets December 2019, I conducted an investigation to determine just how these devices were impacting the streets. Today in 2023 scooters have largely been removed from the streets but it took a good 3 years for that to happen and many accidents, crimes and hurt people just to get the scooters to be parked in designated areas and not completely off the streets. 
This comic was created as a collection of observations I had made within the City of Malmo. I tried to contact the companies and Malm√∂stad to no end. Malm√∂ did not want to take responsibility, they just wanted to take ‚ÄúBig scooter‚Äù money. If it took 3 years to get scooters in designated parking spots it would take longer to get them removed completely, regardless of safety and the environmental impact on the planet.
